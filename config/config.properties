# SCB Marketplace Simulation Configuration
# ========================================

# --- REQUIRED PARAMETERS ---

# Arrival rate of orders at marketplace (milliseconds between orders)
marketplace.order.delay=10000

# Average processing time for an order by a seller (milliseconds)
# Uses normal distribution with these parameters
simulation.processing_time.average=500
simulation.processing_time.std_dev=150

# Probabilities for seller behavior (must sum to 1.0)
# Success: processes and confirms the message
simulation.probability.success=0.7

# Fail without response: accepts but does not process (simulated crash)
simulation.probability.fail_without_response=0.15

# Fail with crash: processes but does not confirm the message
simulation.probability.fail_with_crash=0.15

# --- ADDITIONAL USEFUL PARAMETERS ---

# Timeout for marketplace waiting for seller response (milliseconds)
marketplace.timeout=5000

# Initial stock for each product in seller inventory
seller.initial_stock=5

# --- BUSINESS ERROR SIMULATION ---

# Probability that a product is "accidentally" not available
# (simulates business errors beyond actual stock)
simulation.probability.product_not_available=0.2

# Probability of duplicate product in order (business error)
simulation.probability.duplicate_product=0.1
